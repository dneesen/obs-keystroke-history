# Crash Fix Summary - Keystroke History Plugin

## Issues Fixed in This Build

### 1. GDI+ Initialization
- **Problem**: GDI+ wasn't properly initialized with error checking
- **Fix**: Added thread-safe initialization with status checking and error logging
- **Location**: `src/text-renderer.cpp`

### 2. Exception Handling
- **Problem**: No try-catch blocks around rendering code
- **Fix**: Wrapped entire render_text_to_texture in try-catch with proper error reporting
- **Location**: `src/text-renderer.cpp`

### 3. Font Creation
- **Problem**: Font assignment not allowed in GDI+ (copy constructor is private)
- **Fix**: Use pointer-based font creation with proper cleanup
- **Location**: `src/text-renderer.cpp`

### 4. Input Capture Safety
- **Problem**: Input capture could throw exceptions during initialization
- **Fix**: Added try-catch around start_input_capture() call
- **Location**: `src/keystroke-source.cpp`

### 5. Null Pointer Checks
- **Problem**: Missing validation checks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive null checks and validation
- **Locations**: Multiple files

### 6. Logging
- **Problem**: Insufficient diagnostic information
- **Fix**: Added detailed logging at critical points for debugging
- **Locations**: All source files

## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Using Install Script (Recommended)
1. **Close OBS Studio completely**
2. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   - Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator"
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   cd "d:\OBS Plugins\Keystroke History"
   .\install-plugin.ps1
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. **Close OBS Studio completely**
2. Copy `D:\OBS Plugins\Keystroke History\build\Release\keystroke-history.dll`
3. Paste to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`
   - You'll need administrator privileges
4. Restart OBS Studio

## Testing the Fixed Plugin

1. **Launch OBS Studio**
   - For best results, run OBS as Administrator (keyboard hooks work better)
   - Right-click OBS shortcut → "Run as administrator"

2. **Add the Source**
   - Go to Sources panel
   - Click + (Add Source)
   - Select "Keystroke History"
   - Click OK

3. **Configure Settings**
   - Maximum Entries: 5 (default) or adjust as needed
   - Font: Arial (default) - proven to work reliably
   - Font Size: 24 (default)
   - Font Color: White (#FFFFFFFF)
   - Background: Enabled with 50% opacity
   - Show Mouse Clicks: Enabled
   - Ignore Modifier Keys: Enabled
   - Fade Duration: 3 seconds

4. **Test Functionality**
   - Click anywhere to give focus to another application
   - Type some keys - they should appear in the OBS preview
   - Try key combinations: Ctrl+C, Alt+Tab, etc.
   - Click mouse buttons - clicks should be recorded
   - Try typing in a password field - keystrokes should be hidden

## If OBS Still Crashes

If you still experience crashes after this update:

1. **Check OBS Log Files**
   - In OBS: Help → Log Files → View Current Log
   - Look for lines containing "[Keystroke History]"
   - Send the error messages for further diagnosis

2. **Try Safe Mode Settings**
   - When adding the source, use these minimal settings:
     - Max Entries: 3
     - Font: Arial
     - Font Size: 18
     - Disable Background
     - Disable Mouse Clicks initially
     - Set Fade Duration to 0

3. **Verify OBS DLL Availability**
   - Check if `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs.dll` exists
   - The plugin depends on this DLL being available

4. **System Requirements**
   - Windows 10/11
   - OBS Studio 28.0 or later
   - Visual C++ Redistributables installed

## Debug Information

If you need to report issues, please provide:
- OBS version
- Windows version
