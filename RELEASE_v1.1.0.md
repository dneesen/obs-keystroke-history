## ‚ú® New Features in v1.1.0

  - Newest appears at BOTTOM
  - Stacks upward
  - Anchor point at bottom edge
  - Perfect for bottom-anchored overlays

- ‚òë **Display Newest Entries at Top** (checked)
  - Newest appears at TOP
  - Stacks downward
  - Anchor point at top edge
  - Perfect for top-anchored overlays

**Why it's useful:** Allows proper positioning in your scene without text jumping around.

---

### 2. Font Dropdown Selection
**What it does:** Replaces text input with a curated dropdown of 15 cross-platform fonts.

**Available Fonts:**
- Arial (default)
- Arial Black
- Calibri
- Cambria
- Comic Sans MS
- Consolas
- Courier New
- Georgia
- Impact
- Lucida Console
- Segoe UI

**Why it's useful:** No more typos in font names, only tested fonts available.

---

### 3. OBS Source-Based Filtering ‚≠ê MAJOR FEATURE
**What it does:** Filter keystrokes based on which Display/Window/Game you're capturing in OBS.

**How to use:**
1. Enable "Window/Source Filtering" checkbox
2. Check "Use OBS Source Capture"
3. Select your capture source from dropdown
4. Keystrokes only captured when that source's target is active

**Supported Source Types:**
- **Display Capture:** Filters by which monitor is active
- **Window Capture:** Filters by which window is focused
- **Game Capture:** Filters by which game/application is running

**Why it's useful:** 
- More intuitive than typing window titles
- Matches exactly what you're capturing in OBS
- No guessing at window names

**Note:** Dropdown shows sources from ALL scenes (OBS API limitation). Simply ignore sources from other scenes.

---

### 4. Enhanced Text Rendering
**What it does:** Improved transparent background handling with proper anti-aliasing.

**Improvements:**
- Clean text with no background color bleeding
- Works correctly even if text and background colors are the same
- Proper anti-aliasing on all text edges
- No artifacts or halos around text

**Why it's useful:** Professional-looking text overlays with transparency.

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Display Capture Filtering
- Fixed monitor detection using `monitor_id` (device string)
- Proper Windows display device enumeration
- Accurate matching between OBS sources and active displays

### Text Rendering Algorithm
- Inverse color fill for transparent backgrounds
- Improved pixel detection for anti-aliasing
- Constant source height based on max_entries setting
- Proper anchor point positioning

### Source Enumeration
- Enumerates all Display/Window/Game Capture sources
- Shows sources across all scenes (standard OBS behavior)
- Filtered by source type (only capture sources)

### Logging & Debugging
- Enhanced `[SOURCE-FILTER]` logging
- Monitor device and settings logging
- Better error messages and troubleshooting info

---

## üìã Known Limitations

### Scene Filtering Not Available
**Issue:** Source dropdown shows sources from ALL scenes, not just the current scene.

**Reason:** The OBS Frontend API required for scene detection isn't available to plugins.

**Impact:** Minimal - this is standard behavior for OBS plugins. Users can simply ignore sources from inactive scenes.

**Workaround:** Delete unused sources from scenes you don't use, or simply ignore them in the dropdown.
