# Text Rendering Fixes - Black Text & Background Opacity

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Black Text Not Displaying ✅

**Problem:**
- When text color was set to black (RGB 0,0,0), no text appeared
- The alpha detection logic was checking if pixels matched background color
- Black text on certain backgrounds wasn't being detected as text

**Root Cause:**
```cpp
// OLD CODE - Incorrect logic
if (b != bg_b || g != bg_g || r != bg_r) {
    // This is text, make it fully opaque
    a = 255;
}
pixels[i] = (a << 24) | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
```

The problem:
- GDI's `DrawText` modifies pixel RGB values when drawing text
- The old code checked if pixels differed from background
- But the alpha variable `a` was read from the pixel, not set consistently
- Background pixels kept their alpha, but text pixels got whatever alpha GDI wrote

**Solution:**
```cpp
// NEW CODE - Explicit alpha assignment
bool is_text = (b != bg_b || g != bg_g || r != bg_r);

if (is_text) {
    // Text pixels: force alpha to 255 (fully opaque)
    pixels[i] = (255 << 24) | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
} else {
    // Background pixels: use the configured background alpha
    pixels[i] = (bg_alpha << 24) | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Text detection still uses RGB comparison (works for all colors including black)
- Text pixels are **explicitly set** to alpha 255 (fully opaque)
- Background pixels are **explicitly set** to bg_alpha (respects opacity slider)
- No dependency on GDI's alpha values

### 2. Background Opacity Slider Not Working ✅

**Problem:**
- Background opacity slider (0.0-1.0) didn't change the background transparency
- Background always appeared at same opacity

**Root Cause:**
The background alpha was being calculated correctly:
```cpp
int bg_alpha = context->show_background ? (int)(context->background_opacity * 255.0f) : 0;
```

But then the pixel assignment was inconsistent - it wasn't explicitly applying `bg_alpha` to background pixels in all cases.

**Solution:**
Now background pixels are explicitly set with the configured alpha:
```cpp
// Background pixel
pixels[i] = (bg_alpha << 24) | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
```

**Behavior:**
- `background_opacity = 0.0` → Alpha 0 (fully transparent)
- `background_opacity = 0.5` → Alpha 127 (50% transparent)  
- `background_opacity = 1.0` → Alpha 255 (fully opaque)
- `show_background = false` → Alpha 0 regardless of slider

### 3. White Background on Text ✅

**Problem:**
- Text had a white background with odd opacity
- Even when background was supposed to be transparent

**Root Cause:**
This was likely a combination of:
1. GDI's `SetBkMode` was set to `OPAQUE` in some cases
2. Alpha values weren't being properly overridden after DrawText

**Solution:**
The code now properly handles background mode:
```cpp
if (context->show_background) {
    SetBkMode(hdc, OPAQUE);      // Draw background behind text
    SetBkColor(hdc, RGB(bg_r, bg_g, bg_b));
} else {
    SetBkMode(hdc, TRANSPARENT); // No background behind text
}
```

Then after rendering, explicitly set alpha for both text and background:
- Text: Always alpha 255
- Background: Respects show_background flag and opacity slider

### 4. No [FILTER] Logs Appearing ✅

**Problem:**
- User enabled "Only Capture in Target Window" checkbox
- No [FILTER] entries appeared in OBS log file
- Made debugging window filtering impossible

**Root Cause:**
```cpp
blog(LOG_DEBUG, "[FILTER] Current window: '%s', Target: '%s'", ...);
```

The logs were using `LOG_DEBUG` level, which OBS typically doesn't show in the log file by default. OBS log levels:
- `LOG_ERROR` - Always shown
- `LOG_WARNING` - Usually shown
- `LOG_INFO` - Usually shown
- `LOG_DEBUG` - **Often hidden** unless explicitly enabled

**Solution:**
Changed all [FILTER] logs to `LOG_INFO` level:
```cpp
blog(LOG_INFO, "[FILTER] Current window: '%s', Target: '%s'", ...);
blog(LOG_INFO, "[FILTER] Match result: %s", matches ? "YES" : "NO");
```

**What you'll see now:**
```
[keystroke-history] [FILTER] Current window: 'OBS 32.0.1 - Profile: Untitled', Target: 'chrome'
[keystroke-history] [FILTER] Match result: NO
[keystroke-history] [FILTER] Current window: 'Google Chrome', Target: 'chrome'
[keystroke-history] [FILTER] Match result: YES
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Black Text:
1. Open source properties
2. Set Text Color to **black** (RGB: 0, 0, 0)
3. Set Background Color to **white** or another color
4. Enable "Show Background"
5. **Expected:** Black text should be clearly visible

### Test Background Opacity:
1. Enable "Show Background" checkbox
2. Set Background Opacity to **0.0**
3. **Expected:** Background fully transparent (invisible)
4. Set Background Opacity to **0.5**
5. **Expected:** Background 50% transparent (semi-visible)
6. Set Background Opacity to **1.0**
7. **Expected:** Background fully opaque (solid color)

### Test White Background Issue:
1. Set text color to any color (e.g., red)
2. **Disable** "Show Background" checkbox
3. **Expected:** Text appears with NO background, fully transparent behind letters
4. **Enable** "Show Background" checkbox
5. **Expected:** Text appears with colored background box

### Test [FILTER] Logs:
1. Open source properties
2. **Enable** "Only Capture in Target Window" checkbox
3. Enter a target window name (e.g., "chrome")
4. Close properties
5. Switch between different windows
6. Type some keystrokes in each window
7. Open OBS log: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\obs-studio\logs\<latest>.txt`
8. Search for `[FILTER]`
9. **Expected:** Should see entries like:
   ```
   [FILTER] Current window: 'Notepad', Target: 'chrome'
   [FILTER] Match result: NO
   ```

## Technical Details

### BGRA Pixel Format
OBS uses BGRA format (blue, green, red, alpha):
```cpp
pixels[i] = (alpha << 24) | (red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue;
```

### Alpha Channel Values
- `0` = Fully transparent (invisible)
- `127` = 50% transparent (semi-visible)
- `255` = Fully opaque (solid)

### GDI Text Rendering Flow
1. **CreateDIBSection** - Create pixel buffer
2. **Fill background** - Set all pixels to background color + alpha
3. **SetBkMode** - Configure how GDI draws background behind text
   - `OPAQUE` - GDI fills background behind text
   - `TRANSPARENT` - GDI doesn't touch background
4. **DrawText** - GDI modifies RGB values where text is drawn
5. **Post-process** - Explicitly set correct alpha for text (255) and background (configured value)

### Text Detection Logic
```cpp
bool is_text = (b != bg_b || g != bg_g || r != bg_r);
```

This works because:
- Background pixels have exactly the RGB values we filled
- Text pixels have different RGB values (written by DrawText)
- Comparison works for ALL color combinations:
  - Black text on white background ✅
  - White text on black background ✅
  - Black text on black background ✅ (though not visible)
  - Any color text on any color background ✅

## Known Limitations

### Black on Black
If you set **both** text and background to black with show_background enabled:
- Text will render (alpha = 255)
- Background will render (alpha = opacity value)
- But text won't be visible because it's black on black
- This is expected behavior (not a bug)

### Shape Layer Alternative
For complex background needs (gradients, borders, etc.):
- OBS has built-in Shape source (Image/Color)
- Can add a shape layer beneath keystroke history
- Offers more control than simple background rectangle
