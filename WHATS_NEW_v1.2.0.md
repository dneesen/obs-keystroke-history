# What's New in v1.2.0

## New Features

### 1. Text Justification (Left/Center/Right)
You can now choose how your keystrokes are aligned within the source!

**Location:** Source Properties â†’ Text Alignment

**Options:**
- **Left** (Default) - Text aligns to the left edge
- **Center** - Text is centered horizontally
- **Right** - Text aligns to the right edge

**Use Cases:**
- Left: Traditional, easy to read for lists
- Center: Great for titles or overlay displays
- Right: Useful for right-side screen overlays

### 2. Fixed Text Alignment (Newest at Bottom)
The "Display Newest Entries at Top" checkbox now works correctly when unchecked!

**What Changed:**
When unchecked (newest at bottom mode):
- âœ… The latest keystroke now **always** appears at the actual bottom of the display
- âœ… New keystrokes appear **above** the previous newest entry
- âœ… Entries properly anchor to the bottom edge regardless of count

**Previously:** Entries would float in the middle of the display area when you had fewer entries than the maximum.

**Now:** The newest entry is always anchored to the bottom, making it much easier to position your source!

### 3. Windows Installer (.exe)
You can now install the plugin using a convenient Windows installer!

**Benefits:**
- Automatically detects OBS installation
- Installs to the correct directory
- Creates proper uninstaller
- No manual file copying needed

**Still Available:** Manual installation ZIP for advanced users or non-standard OBS locations.
