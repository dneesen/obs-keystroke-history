## File Sizes (Approximate)

- Manual ZIP: ~30 KB
- Installer EXE: ~35 KB
- Source code: ~50 KB

Total release size: ~115 KB (very lightweight!)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Inno Setup not found"
- Download from: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
- Make sure to install (not just download)

### "OBS Studio not found" during installer compilation
- The installer checks at runtime, not compile time
- This is normal - users need OBS installed, not developers

### ZIP file too large
- Make sure you're only including Release builds
- Don't include debug symbols (.pdb files)

### DLL not found during packaging
- Build the plugin first: `cmake --build . --config Release`
- Check that `build\Release\keystroke-history.dll` exists

---

## Automation (Optional)

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

You can automate building and releasing:

1. Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`
2. Configure to build on tag push
3. Automatically create releases with artifacts

Example workflow:
- Build plugin on Windows runner
- Create packages
- Upload to GitHub Releases

---

## Summary

**For quick distribution**:
1. Run `.\create-package.ps1`
2. Upload `obs-keystroke-history-manual-install.zip` to GitHub Releases

**For professional distribution**:
1. Install Inno Setup
2. Run `.\create-package.ps1`
3. Compile `installer.iss`
4. Upload both ZIP and EXE to GitHub Releases

Both methods work great - the ZIP is simpler, the EXE is more user-friendly!
